 Candidate Elimination algorithm
 -------------------------------

 Purpose:
 -------

The purpose of this code is to learn a hypothesis that describes a target concept from a given dataset. In this case, the target concept is binary, with two possible values: "Yes" or "No." The code aims to find the most specific and general hypotheses that fit the training data.

Working:
-------

1)Import necessary libraries:
The code imports the numpy and pandas libraries to work with data efficiently.

2) Load Data:
It loads the training data from a CSV file called 'trainingdata.csv' using Pandas and stores it in a DataFrame called data.
It prints the loaded data to the console.

3) Separating Concepts and Target:
The code separates the concept features (attributes) from the target column.
It stores the concept features in the concepts array and the target values in the target array.
It prints both the concept features and the target values.

4) Define the learn function:
This function implements the learning method of the Candidate Elimination algorithm.
It takes the concept features (concepts) and the target values (target) as input.

5) Initialize Specific and General Hypotheses:
The algorithm initializes the specific hypothesis (specific_h) with the first instance from the concepts.
It initializes the general hypothesis (general_h) as a list of question marks ('?') with the same length as specific_h.

6) Learning Iterations:
The algorithm iterates through each example in the training data.
If the target for the current example is "Yes," it updates the specific and general hypotheses as follows:
If the current feature in the example doesn't match the corresponding feature in the specific hypothesis, it updates that feature to '?' in both specific_h and general_h.
If the target is "No," it updates the general hypothesis:
If the current feature doesn't match the specific hypothesis, it updates that feature in general_h to match the specific hypothesis.
Otherwise, it updates the feature in general_h to '?' to indicate uncertainty.
After each iteration, it prints the current state of specific_h and general_h.

7 )Clean General Hypothesis:
The algorithm identifies and removes any rows from general_h that are entirely filled with '?' since they do not provide any meaningful information.

8) Final Output:
The specific and general hypotheses (s_final and g_final) are printed to the console to represent the learned concepts.


The Candidate Elimination algorithm, as implemented in this code, incrementally updates the specific and general hypotheses based on the training data to find a hypothesis that best fits the observed examples. This algorithm is especially useful for concept learning in symbolic or discrete domains.
